# 🛠️ Smart Hardware Lab Management System

**Smart Hardware Lab** is a Flutter & Firebase-based IoT-enabled platform for managing a university or lab’s hardware inventory. It combines real-time tracking, RFID authentication, and student authorization to automate equipment checkouts and monitoring.

---

## 🌟 Project Highlights

- **IoT Integration:** Hardware items are tagged with RFID for secure automated check-in/check-out.
- **Inventory Management:** Track all equipment, availability, and student possession in real-time.
- **User Roles & Authorization:**
  - **Students:** Can borrow and return equipment, view their history.
  - **Admins / Lab Supervisors:** Manage hardware inventory, monitor usage, and generate reports.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Powered by Firebase Realtime Database to instantly reflect hardware status.
- **Media Support:** Equipment and categories include images stored in Firebase Storage.
- **Analytics & Logging:** Tracks historical checkouts, overdue items, and usage metrics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Flutter, Dart
- **Backend & Services:** Firebase (Auth, Realtime Database, Storage)
- **Authentication:** Firebase Email/Password and Role-based Access Control
- **Real-time Data:** StreamBuilders to reflect live changes in inventory and checkouts
- **State Management:** Flutter `setState` with potential for `Provider`/`Riverpod` integration
- **UI Components:** Custom widgets for categories, equipment cards, and checkout/cart system
